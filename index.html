    <p class="text">About six or seven years ago, family members started giving me books about baking bread.  When this began, I was an occasional baker who relied on a bread baking machine.  The machine put forth a consistent, rectangular loaf that made good sandwich bread.  Our relationship -- the machine's and mine -- was stable and respectable.  If I had taken the machine home to meet Mom and Pop for Sunday dinner, they would have approved of our sober union.

    <p class="text"> But when these new books entered my life, something changed. They became the Aladdin to my Jasmine, showing me things I had never seen and suggesting ideas I couldn't get out of my head: </p>

    <ul class="procedureListBox">
      <li class="procedureList">Throw out measuring cups and calculate ingredients by weight. </li>
      <li class="procedureList">Avoid kneading dough by thinking of time and ambient temperature as ingredients. </li>
      <li class="procedureList"> Bake bread in a pot in the oven. </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text">I began playing around with these methods, and I made plenty of mistakes along the way.  But eventually my oven began turning out round loaves that looked stolen from a bakery, not square, uniform, boring loaves made by some robot.  My poor bread machine saw the writing on the wall, packed up its things quickly, and moved into the basement.<p>

    <p class="text"><img class="floatLeft" src="images/slop2.jpg" style="height: 100px;
      width: 120px;">Seeing the end product from these methods was thrilling, but so was the <i>process</i> of implementing them.  I really jived with measuring ingredients by weight and trying to be thoughtful about time, temperature, and environment generally. The process also reminded me of the childhood fun of  grabbing  <img class="floatRight" src="images/miracle3.jpg"> everything from the pantry, mixing it all together as a "magic potion," and begging family to try the undoubtedly delicious resulting brown slop.  But now, with these methods of bread baking, the magic worked and people actually wanted to eat what I mixed together.  It was a miracle.

    <p class="text">I can't claim to have any professional skills as a baker. What skills I do have are due to bakers who  generously shared their research and methods through the books that my family gave me.  If you have never baked bread before, I hope this site inspires you to get your hands floury and give it a go. Under "Let's Bake Something," you'll find my go-to recipe for making a loaf like the one pictured below.  It's a great recipe for beginners.  The recipe looks like it has a lot of procedural details, but I've included these details only in the hope that they help new bakers avoid my early mistakes and make life easier for seasoned home bakers. It's ultimately a very easy recipe that produces very good results.  Best of luck on your baking adventures!
